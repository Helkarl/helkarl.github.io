        <h2>Welcome to my portfolio!</h2>
        <p>I've spent the last few years working as an analyst consultant, where the majority of my projects have involved tracking implementations and measurement frameworks. I have worked with clients across B2B, e-commerce, SaaS, and Swedish authorities.<br><br>
          Since many professional projects are confidential, I created this portfolio to offer a glimpse into my skills through stripped-down examples. It also reflects my growing focus on Business Intelligence and Data Engineering. </p>

    data-description='In my current consultancy assignment, I support the client with data mapping, cleansing, transformation, and migration as part of a shift to a new data infrastructure. The organization is transitioning from a single ERP system that is used to manage key business processes like finance, HR, sales, and procurement - to several specialized systems. These new solutions are expected to offer improved interfaces and usability for end users, ensuring that the right data reaches the right people at the right time.<br><br>Iâ€™m also contributing to an AI initiative by preparing and transforming data that will be used to build predictive models, which will be integrated into the new ERP landscape.'
    data-images='["images/erp.png"]'

    data-challenge-title="ðŸš§ Challenge: Merging HR data sources with different time periods"
    data-challenge="One example of a challenge I faced within this project was when I worked with HR datasets. I worked with two different datasets, one with employment details and one with workplace history. Each had its own start and end dates. The challenge was to find the time periods when a person was both employed and linked to a workplace - without going outside the valid dates from either dataset. This format was required to be able to migrate to one of the new HR systems."
    data-solution-title="ðŸŽ¯ Solution"
    data-solution= "To solve this I used a custom M script within Power Query to merge the datasets and handle overlapping date logic, in several steps:&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;1. Merging the tables&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
I used Table.NestedJoin with a Left Outer Join to combine the employment data with workplace history based on the employee number. This ensured all employment records were kept, even if no matching workplace data existed. I then expanded the necessary fields from the joined table.
&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code class=&amp;quot;language-powerquery&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
Merged = Table.NestedJoin(TypedAnstform, {&amp;quot;Resursnr.&amp;quot;}, TypedArbstalle, {&amp;quot;Resursnr.&amp;quot;}, &amp;quot;Merged&amp;quot;, JoinKind.LeftOuter),
Expanded = Table.ExpandTableColumn(Merged, &amp;quot;Merged&amp;quot;, {&amp;quot;Arbst(T)&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Arbst FrÃ¥n dat&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Arbst Till dat&amp;quot;}, {&amp;quot;Arbst(T)&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Arbst FrÃ¥n dat&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Arbst Till dat&amp;quot;})

&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;2. Calculating the start date&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
I added a new column called &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;Start&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; to determine the beginning of the valid period. It selects the later (more restrictive) of the employment start or workplace start dates. If either value is missing, the existing one is used.
&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code class=&amp;quot;language-powerquery&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
AddStart = Table.AddColumn(Expanded, &amp;quot;Start&amp;quot;, each 
    let a = [#&amp;quot;Anstform FrÃ¥n dat&amp;quot;], b = [#&amp;quot;Arbst FrÃ¥n dat&amp;quot;]
    in if a = null then b else if b = null then a else if a &amp;gt; b then a else b, type date)

&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;3. Calculating the end date&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
Similarly, I added a column called &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;End&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;, taking the earlier (more restrictive) of the two end dates. If either end date is missing, it is replaced with December 31 9999, a placeholder to avoid limiting the period too soon.
&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code class=&amp;quot;language-powerquery&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
AddEnd = Table.AddColumn(AddStart, &amp;quot;End&amp;quot;, each 
    let a = if [#&amp;quot;Anstform Till dat&amp;quot;] = null then #date(9999,12,31) else [#&amp;quot;Anstform Till dat&amp;quot;],
        b = if [#&amp;quot;Arbst Till dat&amp;quot;] = null then #date(9999,12,31) else [#&amp;quot;Arbst Till dat&amp;quot;]
    in if a &amp;lt; b then a else b, type date)

&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;

&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;b&amp;gt;4. Filtering valid periods&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;
Finally, I filtered the table to keep only the rows where &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;Start&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt; is on or before &amp;lt;code&amp;gt;End&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;. This ensured that all periods were logically valid and prevented further analysis from being impacted by incorrectly overlapping or reversed date ranges. (Rows that was not logically valid were handled seperately.)
&amp;lt;pre&amp;gt;&amp;lt;code class=&amp;quot;language-powerquery&amp;quot;&amp;gt;
FilteredValidPeriods = Table.SelectRows(AddEnd, each [Start] &amp;lt;= [End])

&amp;lt;/code&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/pre&amp;gt;"

This included packaging a new area of work focused on supporting clients in meeting WCAG requirements, because of the European Accessibility Act taking effect in June 2025. Collaborating with UX-designers and developers, I organized internal workflows, evaluated and selected appropriate tools for both automated and manual testing, and influenced the way we communicated the new accessibility offering to clients.<br><br>I documented a standardized process and deliverable in the form of an Accessibility Analysis report.<br>As part of the delivery, I conducted Accessibility Audits, and translated findings into actionable recommendations for developers, designers, and content editors. <br><br> This project has provided me with in-depth technical knowledge of accessibility standards and common web accessibility issues, including semantic HTML, ARIA roles and keyboard navigation.
